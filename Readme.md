## Overview
This repository contains a reproduction for [Password Guessing Using Random Forest](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23/presentation/wang-ding-password-guessing) paper in which author raised a series of new methods to translate PII data(Personal Identifiable Information) into structures that perform pretty well in classical machine learning models.
I have implemented the key concept of the paper and programmed a easy-to-use tool for training models, generating patterns, conducting guesses and assessing accuracy. This repo contributes:
- A GUI program exclusive for PII-based targeted password guessing scenario
- A pretrained random forest model

## Features
- **Targeted password guessing based on PII**(crack the password of a given user)
- A pre-trained model(TODO:clf file link) ready to use which is trained on a dataset with 11w data
- Generate password patterns based on PII dataset
- Conduct password guesses for given personal information
- Support to train specified model for self-defined datasets
- Support to assess the accuracy of generated guesses


[//]: # (## Getting Started)

## Prerequisites

- Python3
- Sklearn<a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html"> Here</a>
- Mkdocs(Optional for doc build)<a href="https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/installation/"> Here</a>
- PyQt5<a href="https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/"> Here</a>


## Installation

TODO
```bash
pip install -r requirements_bak.txt
```


## Usage

Enter the repository main folder and run:
```bash
py main.py
```
This will launch the GUI program and you will see the panel as below:
TODO
Or you can get a executable file at [release](TODO).

There are three main modules in the user interface: guess-generator, pattern-generator and model-trainner. 

### Generate pattern(pattern-generator)
First you should get a trained model(whether train by yourself in [model-trainner](#train-your-own-model) or use the pretrained model at [rfguess.clf](TODO)).
Then you could set a limitation on the number of pattern to generated and start generating.

1. Load model(.clf)
2. Assign output path and set limit



### Generate password dictionary(guess-generator)
This module requires a pattern file(see [Appendix](TODO) for more detail) and PII data of the target user. You can load the pattern file generated by pattern-generator or use the [default pattern file](TODO).

1. Load pattern file
2. Fill in PII data
3. Generate password dictionary


### Train your own model
The model training procession of Machine Learning is pretty more hassle than that of Deep Learning. Algorithms in this program need to use mysql database to store intermediate data structures while processing original dataset. Fortunately, you only need to have a mysql server normally running and just provide a database Url to connect. All the data structures will be configured automatically.


1. Connect to your database and import database structure
2. Load your pii dataset(.txt)
3. Analyze and process dataset
4. Train model
5. Assess accuracy
6. Restore the status of last run
