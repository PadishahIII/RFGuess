<h1>RFGuess(Random Forest Password Guessing model)</h1>



</div>

# Overview
This repository contains the reproduction for the paper [Password Guessing Using Random Forest](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23/presentation/wang-ding-password-guessing). The author proposes a set of new methods to translate PII(Personal Identifiable Information) data into structures that perform quite well in classical machine learning models.
I have implemented the main concept of the paper and programmed an easy-to-use tool for training models, generating patterns, conducting guesses and evaluating accuracy. This repo contributes:
- A GUI program exclusively for the PII-based targeted password guessing scenario
- A pre-trained model

If you are looking for more knowledge about the underlying logic and training process of this project, [this article](https://www.wolai.com/secnote/aL4Xth452sX4XuSydnpqtj) provides more details about the algorithm and the corresponding transcript is available [here](https://www.wolai.com/secnote/row4spm7VvaYAkUmxsFQBT).

[//]: # (## Getting Started)

# Prerequisites

- Python3
- Mysql 8.0.32
- Sklearn<a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html"> Here</a>
- PyQt5<a href="https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/"> Here</a>

# Install & Launch
Clone this repo to your local, install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This project use Mysql to store analysis data, you can launch a prepared database in docker which is recommended:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
And connect to `mysql://root:root@127.0.0.1:3307/rfguess`.

Or if you expect to use a custom database, you should import `user.sql` into your database manually, which will create all the data tables.

Launch the user interface:
```bash
python main.py
```

# Usage

- [Main window](#main-window)

- [Generate pattern](#generate-patternpattern-generator)

- [Generate password dictionary](#generate-password-dictionaryguess-generator)

- [Train your own model](#train-your-own-model)


## Main window

Run the executable file and you will see the panel as below:
![1](https://github.com/PadishahIII/RFGuess/assets/83501709/18c4a5e8-8e6c-4593-9c75-3c3f1b634969)




There are three main modules in the user interface: Guess-Generator, Pattern-Generator and Model-Trainner.

## Generate pattern(Pattern-Generator)
First you should get a trained model(whether you train by yourself in [model-trainner](#train-your-own-model) or use the pre-trained model from [rfguess.clf](https://github.com/PadishahIII/RFGuess/releases/download/v1.1/model.clf)).
Then set a limit on the number of patterns to be generated and start generating.

1. Load model(.clf)
![2](https://github.com/PadishahIII/RFGuess/assets/83501709/d6fcc6b2-dc39-43fc-8009-9521d8f96deb)



2. Assign output path and limit
![3](https://github.com/PadishahIII/RFGuess/assets/83501709/a3476070-35fa-4c82-a0ab-a660b0722875)




## Generate password dictionary(Guess-Generator)
This module requires a pattern file(see [Appendix](#appendix) for more detail) and PII data of the target user. You can load the pattern file generated by Pattern-Generator or use the [default pattern file](https://github.com/PadishahIII/RFGuess/releases/download/v1.1/patterns.txt).

1. Load pattern file
![4](https://github.com/PadishahIII/RFGuess/assets/83501709/522a0885-b47c-4373-ab83-6ec479cfcf6c)



2. Fill in PII data
Input the personal data of the target user or load data from json file([format](https://github.com/PadishahIII/RFGuess/blob/v1.1/pii.json))
![5](https://github.com/PadishahIII/RFGuess/assets/83501709/b0e7a1ad-37fc-49f5-95d9-d50be3a5996d)


![6](https://github.com/PadishahIII/RFGuess/assets/83501709/2eab05b2-0d1e-4740-bcb0-f41efee33f4d)



3. Generate password dictionary
![7](https://github.com/PadishahIII/RFGuess/assets/83501709/4f1c2279-c9df-41e8-8938-bb9a542a0ac8)




## Train your own model
The model training process of Machine-Learning is pretty more laborious than that of Deep-Learning. The algorithms in this program need to use mysql database to store intermediate data structures while processing the original dataset. Fortunately, you just need to have a normal running mysql server and just provide a database url to connect to. All the data structures are configured automatically.


1. Connect to your database and import database structure

Connect to database URL:
![8](https://github.com/PadishahIII/RFGuess/assets/83501709/c0f3055e-c5d0-4613-8be8-ddee2b1df729)


Import sql file(get [here](https://github.com/PadishahIII/RFGuess/blob/v1.1/database_structure.sql)). **Note that, this script would drop and recreate data tables that are in business(you can checkout and modify the table names in `Parse/Config.py`).**
If you start mysql server by docker-compose(which is the recommended way), the `user.sql` has already imported at the start time, so you can just skip this step.
![9](https://github.com/PadishahIII/RFGuess/assets/83501709/4f4e7a6e-9a6c-49e3-9806-d73c2ac34e8d)


2. Load your PII dataset(.txt)

The PII dataset should in csv format and comply with the principles below:
  - the first line presents field names
     - field name should fall into ['account', 'name', 'phone', 'idcard', 'email', 'password'], **case-insensitive**
     - you can include any combination of the allowed fields but ***name*** and ***password*** are mandatory
  - each line contains one PII data
  - each line should have several fields and separated by comma
  - blank characters will be ignored


A legal dataset is presented like:
```
name, email, password, phone
张三, 350777@aa.com , zhangsan, 111122222
John, 3333@bb.com, 3333, 44444
Jason Harris, aaaa@aa.com, 5555, 5555
```

You can specify the character set of the target dataset by *Charset* edit box.
![image](https://github.com/PadishahIII/RFGuess/assets/83501709/bb8a1741-fa3c-45ef-b305-260c58cab286)


Push *Load PII Data* button and wait. Your dataset will be consumed and stored in database after some procession.
![10](https://github.com/PadishahIII/RFGuess/assets/83501709/4fb33e8c-999c-4bc9-9bba-d1b9e3c31d61)



4. Analyze and process dataset

This step will analyze the PII dataset to some intermediate data.
![11](https://github.com/PadishahIII/RFGuess/assets/83501709/03f1141e-b59d-41fd-b2f7-23d7a772f9a7)



6. Train model

You will train a classifier model and dump into a .clf file.
![12](https://github.com/PadishahIII/RFGuess/assets/83501709/a9aff7ca-274a-4c32-9900-e8cb9bb25110)



8. Evaluate accuracy

To evaluate the accuracy of a model, this step uses 50% of your dataset as train-set and other 50% as test-set, generates a password dictionary for each PII data and checks whether the correct password falls into the dictionary.
![13](https://github.com/PadishahIII/RFGuess/assets/83501709/6fda460b-1ab6-4284-b7cf-4d4a07a94c75)



9. Restore the status of last run
10.
Use "Update Status" button to load the progress of the last run and check the status of each phase.
![14](https://github.com/PadishahIII/RFGuess/assets/83501709/e85b101c-75b0-40e2-8bd5-8a9ec0fa5768)


# Advanced Configuration
See more detailed configuration at [Config.py](https://github.com/PadishahIII/RFGuess/blob/master/Parser/Config.py).

**Algorithm configuration**


*Markov n-gram* model is used in the main algorithm, you can set *n* by *pii_order* parameter:
```python
pii_order = 6
```

You can control the limit of guesses by the two following thresholds, which are calculated according to the possibility of the growing pattern.
A pattern is adopted only if its possibility is greater than the threshold. So the larger is the threshold, the lesser is the number of guesses, vice verse. It is notable that you should not set the threshold excessively small(lesser than *1e-11*) to avoid overwhelming by useless patterns.

```python
general_generator_threshold = 1.2e-8
```

**Database configuration**


You can config the table names of database as you like:
```python
class TableNames:
    PII = "PII"
    pwrepresentation = "pwrepresentation"
    representation_frequency = "representation_frequency"
    pwrepresentation_frequency = "pwrepresentation_frequency"
    pwrepresentation_unique = "pwrepresentation_unique"
    pwrepresentation_general = f"{pwrepresentation}_general"
    representation_frequency_base_general = f"representation_frequency_base_general"
    representation_frequency_general = f"{representation_frequency}_general"
    pwrepresentation_frequency_general = f"{pwrepresentation_frequency}_general"
    pwrepresentation_unique_general = f"{pwrepresentation_unique}_general"
```

**Classifier configuration**


Tune the parameters of random forest by the following config:
```python
class RFParams:
    n_estimators = 30
    criterion = 'gini'
    min_samples_leaf = 10
    max_features = 0.8
```
